Last week, [Hans Puac](https://twitter.com/hanspuac), a colleague of mine, wrote a small guide into our internal company
chat on how to migrate your local PHP environment on macOS to the new Homebrew version 1.5.*.
The guide helped a lot of other engineers inside [trivago](https://www.trivago.com/).
I thought it might help more people from the internet.
I asked Hans if I am allowed to share it, and he approved.
So kudos belongs to him.
Here we go:

With Homebrew 1.5.0 the tap `homebrew/php` got deprecated.
They migrated it to `homebrew/core`, but this is changing the installation process completely.
If you want to migrate:

## 1. Cleanup

Remove your currently installed php-packages.
This is not 100% necessary, but I wanted to have it clean.

You can check what packages are installed via `brew list | grep php` for example and remove via `brew remove MYPACKAGE`.
Check for leftovers in `/usr/local/etc/php/` and remove if necessary.
Untap the deprecated repo `brew untap homebrew/php`.
You can check your taps with `brew tap`.
I also had some other taps that I directly untapped as well because those were deprecated:

- `brew untap homebrew/science`
- `brew untap homebrew/versions`

## 2. Update

`brew update`

## 3. Install PHP

Install PHP via `brew install php@7.2`

## 4. Verify Installation

Before we continue, we want to ensure that the

- PHP installation was successful
- [PATH] is set properly
- [PEAR] is configured properly

Run `php --version`, `php --ini` and `pear config-show | grep php.ini` and check if everything is pointing to the right
PHP version and that no warnings are displayed.

If you encounter any problems, check the [Troubleshooting]({{< ref "/post/homebrew-migrate-your-php-setup.md#troubleshooting" >}}) section
below.

## 5. Install Extensions

The `intl` is now already built in.
Install all other required extensions via [PECL][] (gets installed together with PHP).

Installation via pecl requires autoconf (`brew install autoconf`):

- `pecl install xdebug`
- `pecl install redis`
- `pecl install apcu`
- `pecl install memcached`
- `pecl install imagick`
...

### Particular version of an extension

If your app depends on a particular version of an extension, e.g. [redis in v3.1.6](https://pecl.php.net/package/redis)
specify the version explicitly via `pecl install redis-3.1.6`.

### Extension `snmp`

If you rely on the [SNMP Extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.snmp.php), I have to disappoint you right now.
This extension is, state of now (2018-04-10), not part of this PHP build:

> SNMP was excluded from the build because it crashes Apache.

## 6. Cleanup

To make some disk space free, you may remove old versions of packages by executing `brew cleanup -s`.

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong PHP Version is displayed

If `php --version` is displaying the wrong PHP version try to open a new terminal window. The [PATH] variable got
adjusted during the PHP installation and might not be loaded in your current terminal session.

If the old version is still displayed check your [PATH] (`echo $PATH`) and ensure that `/usr/local/bin/` comes before
`/usr/bin/` or uninstall the other PHP version if the [PATH] was already set properly. The commands
`ls -la $(which php)` and `brew list | grep php` might help you find out where that version is coming from.

### [PEAR] configuration is pointing to the wrong `php.ini` file

If `pear config-show | grep php.ini` is pointing to the wrong `php.ini` file you can simply overwrite it with
`pear config-set php_ini /MY/RIGHT/PATH/php.ini`. You can find out the right path with `php --ini`.

### Module already loaded / Unable to load library

Example Warnings:

- `PHP Warning:  Module '[some module]' already loaded in Unknown on line 0`
- `PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '[some module]' ([...]) in Unknown on line 0`

During the installation of an extension, pecl is adding the extension to the `php.ini` file but not removing it
during uninstall. In this case edit your `php.ini` manually and remove deprecated `extension="[some module]"` lines.
