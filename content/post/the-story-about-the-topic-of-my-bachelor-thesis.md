This post is about my bachelor thesis, a conference, incredible people from Spain, some academic papers, a lot of open source, and how it can be if you let the flow runs :)

Everything started in February 2013.
At this time, I studied business informatics next to my full-time job at wmdb Systems GmbH as a software developer (mainly as a web developer for [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/ "TYPO3 Content Management System") related projects).

The regular time of this course of studies is seven semesters.
In February 2013, I was in the 5th semester, and I passed every exam.
Just in (regular) time.

In the 7th semester, I had to write my bachelor thesis.
A scientific paper about a specific topic with ~40-60 pages.
I was thinking a lot about a possible topic, and I knew that I wanted to write something about software, software development, etc.
But I did not have a specific topic in mind at this time.

On 2nd & 3rd, February 2013, I visited [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/ "FOSDEM Conference") in Brussels, Belgium for the first time with some of my friends.
It was not far away from my hometown (~200 km), so it was a very short ride.
And due to the wide range of topics, this conference sounds very interesting!

At the conference, I attend many talks about different topics.
But one talk was special for me: [Do you want to measure your project?](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/do_you_want_to_measure_your_project/ "Do you want to measure your project? at FOSDEM") by [Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona](https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/speaker/jesus_m_gonzalez_barahona/ "Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona Speaker Profile") ([Video](https://ftp.fau.de/fosdem/2013/lightningtalks/Do_you_want_to_measure_your_project_.webm "Video of Do you want to measure your project?"), [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jgbarah/do-you-want-to-measure-your-project "Slides of Do you want to measure your project?")).
Jesus talks about [Metrics Grimoire](https://metricsgrimoire.github.io/ "Metrics Grimoire at GitHub"), a toolset to crawl data which were produced during software development and [Viz Grimoire](https://vizgrimoire.bitergia.org/ "Viz Grimoire at GitHub"), a toolset to visualize the received data.
Some tools of MetricsGrimoire are [CVSAnalY](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY "CVSAnalY at GitHub") to crawl VCS (CVS, Subversion, Git, ...), [Bicho](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/Bicho "Bicho at GitHub") to extract data from Bugtracker (Jira, Redmine, Mantis, ...) or [MLStats](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats "MLStats at GitHub") to get email content from mailing lists.

After every conference, I`m very motivated to start new things and have a more in-depth look at topics where I attend talks.
This was the same for FOSDEM.
After the conference, I had a more in-depth look at CVSAnaly.
I downloaded it, installed it, and started to crawl some repositories I know (e.g. [TYPO3.CMS.git](https://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git "TYPO3 Content Management System Git Repository")).
Sixteen days after the conference, I began to contribute to CVSAnaly with [a short notice about the max_allowed_packet of MySQL](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commit/d69e569d2dff5fa8e98cc0f3c414071eaaf37984 "Commit Add a notice about "max_allowed_packet" to README") for the first time.

At this time, I didn`t write one line [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python programing language").
But every programmer has to learn one language per year.
I started to learn Python and [continued contribution to CVSAnaly](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commits?author=andygrunwald "Contributions to CVSAnaly by Andy Grunwald").
In the same time ([Apr 19, 2013](https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commit/b44dd91e359ad55478919cc94278d26fffbdde03 "Initial Commit of Jacobine by Andy Grunwald")) I started [TYPO3-Analytics](https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine "TYPO3-Analytics (now Jacobine) at GitHub"), a project to analyze and visualize various data sources of the TYPO3 ecosystem based on open/standard APIs.
CVSAnaly was integrated into this analysis suite.

From my point of view, the topic of analyzing data that will be produced during software development was fascinating because I'm a software developer.
And how cool is it to get new information and knowledge from data you have produced?!? So I continued to develop TYPO3-Analytics and started to do some little research about the [Mining Software Repositories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_Software_Repositories "Mining Software Repositories at Wikipedia") field.

Due to this enthusiasm, I found my topic for my bachelor thesis: Software Repository Mining - Concept and Potentials.
In October / November 2013, I looked for a professor as an adviser, registered this topic at my university, started to research, and wrote this paper.
I continued to work at TYPO3-Analytics and CVSAnaly.
During this time, I found a lot of exciting papers about programming topics.
Here is a small list of this paper (if you want more, just ping me ;)):

* [An Analysis of the Dynamic Behavior of JavaScript Programs](https://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/dynjs/pldi275-richards.pdf "Paper An Analysis of the Dynamic Behavior of JavaScript Programs")
* [Analysis of Signature Change Patterns](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.76.3203&rep=rep1&type=pdf "Paper Analysis of Signature Change Patterns")
* [Will My Patch Make It? And How Fast? Case Study on the Linux Kernel](https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/729012 "Paper Will My Patch Make It? And How Fast? Case Study on the Linux Kernel")

At [1st & 2nd February 2014 the FOSDEM event](https://fosdem.org/2014/ "FOSDEM 2014") retakes places in Brussels, Belgium.
Due to the communication at the [MetricsGrimoire mailinglist](https://lists.libresoft.es/listinfo/metrics-grimoire "MetricsGrimoire mailinglist") i knew that people from [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/ "Bitergia") ([@jgbarah](https://twitter.com/jgbarah/ "Jesus M Gonzalez-Barahona at twitter"), [@sanacl](https://twitter.com/sanacl "Luis Cañas-Díaz at twitter"), [@dizquierdo](https://twitter.com/dizquierdo "Daniel Izquierdo at twitter"), etc.) were there as well.
I [twittered that I want to meet them](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/428850540228132864 "Contacting Bitergia via twitter") and ~1 hour later we had a lovely chat in the cafeteria of the University of Brussels.
I showed and talked about the concepts of TYPO3-Analysis and got positive feedback.

~13 months later (since FOSDEM 2013), many things happen.
I learned about ...
- new tools (CVSAnaly, Bicho, ...)
- a new programing language (Python)
- a lot of programming experience
- concepts with new tools (TYPO3-Analytics, [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ "Message queue system RabbitMQ"), [supervisord](https://supervisord.org/ "Software supervisord"), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Software Vagrant"), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra "Software Chef")...)
- new friendly and interesting people (Jesus, Luis, Daniel, ...)
- a fresh business concept (Bitergia)
- much new knowledge about an exciting research field I did not know before (Mining Software Repositories)

And finally, I passed my Bachelor of Science degree today.

And the whole story might be another one if I had not to visit FOSDEM in February 2013.
A huge THANK YOU to all people who were part of this story (creator of tools, speaker, twitterer, IRC chat attendees, and other community members of the open-source world).
The whole time was a lot of fun.
Of course, there was stress, too.
But the fun was much more prominent.

And what is the conclusion of this story? I do not know.
Maybe visit conferences and be part of an amazing community? I do not know.
But I can recommend this way to try it out! If you need help to get into it, because you do not know how: Ping me :)
I will help you do get the right foot in!
