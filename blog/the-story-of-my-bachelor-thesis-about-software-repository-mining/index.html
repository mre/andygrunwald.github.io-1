, <a href=https://andygrunwald.com/tags/open-source/>Open Source</a></p></header><section class=post-content><p>This post is about my bachelor thesis, a conference, incredible people from Spain, some academic papers, a lot of open source, and how it can be if you let the flow runs :)</p><p>Everything started in February 2013.
At this time, I studied business informatics next to my full-time job at wmdb Systems GmbH as a software developer (mainly as a web developer for <a href=https://typo3.org/ title="TYPO3 Content Management System">TYPO3</a> related projects).</p><p>The regular time of this course of studies is seven semesters.
In February 2013, I was in the 5th semester, and I passed every exam.
Just in (regular) time.</p><p>In the 7th semester, I had to write my bachelor thesis.
A scientific paper about a specific topic with ~40-60 pages.
I was thinking a lot about a possible topic, and I knew that I wanted to write something about software, software development, etc.
But I did not have a specific topic in mind at this time.</p><p>On 2nd & 3rd, February 2013, I visited <a href=https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/ title="FOSDEM Conference">FOSDEM</a> in Brussels, Belgium for the first time with some of my friends.
It was not far away from my hometown (~200 km), so it was a very short ride.
And due to the wide range of topics, this conference sounds very interesting!</p><p>At the conference, I attend many talks about different topics.
But one talk was special for me: <a href=https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/do_you_want_to_measure_your_project/ title="Do you want to measure your project? at FOSDEM">Do you want to measure your project?</a> by <a href=https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/speaker/jesus_m_gonzalez_barahona/ title="Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona Speaker Profile">Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona</a> (<a href=https://ftp.fau.de/fosdem/2013/lightningtalks/Do_you_want_to_measure_your_project_.webm title="Video of Do you want to measure your project?">Video</a>, <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/jgbarah/do-you-want-to-measure-your-project title="Slides of Do you want to measure your project?">Slides</a>).
Jesus talks about <a href=https://metricsgrimoire.github.io/ title="Metrics Grimoire at GitHub">Metrics Grimoire</a>, a toolset to crawl data which were produced during software development and <a href=https://vizgrimoire.bitergia.org/ title="Viz Grimoire at GitHub">Viz Grimoire</a>, a toolset to visualize the received data.
Some tools of MetricsGrimoire are <a href=https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY title="CVSAnalY at GitHub">CVSAnalY</a> to crawl VCS (CVS, Subversion, Git, &mldr;), <a href=https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/Bicho title="Bicho at GitHub">Bicho</a> to extract data from Bugtracker (Jira, Redmine, Mantis, &mldr;) or <a href=https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/MailingListStats title="MLStats at GitHub">MLStats</a> to get email content from mailing lists.</p><p>After every conference, I`m very motivated to start new things and have a more in-depth look at topics where I attend talks.
This was the same for FOSDEM.
After the conference, I had a more in-depth look at CVSAnaly.
I downloaded it, installed it, and started to crawl some repositories I know (e.g. <a href=https://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git title="TYPO3 Content Management System Git Repository">TYPO3.CMS.git</a>).
Sixteen days after the conference, I began to contribute to CVSAnaly with [a short notice about the max_allowed_packet of MySQL](<a href=https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commit/d69e569d2dff5fa8e98cc0f3c414071eaaf37984>https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commit/d69e569d2dff5fa8e98cc0f3c414071eaaf37984</a> &ldquo;Commit Add a notice about &ldquo;max_allowed_packet&rdquo; to README&rdquo;) for the first time.</p><p>At this time, I didn`t write one line <a href=https://www.python.org/ title="Python programing language">Python</a>.
But every programmer has to learn one language per year.
I started to learn Python and <a href="https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY/commits?author=andygrunwald" title="Contributions to CVSAnaly by Andy Grunwald">continued contribution to CVSAnaly</a>.
In the same time (<a href=https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine/commit/b44dd91e359ad55478919cc94278d26fffbdde03 title="Initial Commit of Jacobine by Andy Grunwald">Apr 19, 2013</a>) I started <a href=https://github.com/andygrunwald/Jacobine title="TYPO3-Analytics (now Jacobine) at GitHub">TYPO3-Analytics</a>, a project to analyze and visualize various data sources of the TYPO3 ecosystem based on open/standard APIs.
CVSAnaly was integrated into this analysis suite.</p><p>From my point of view, the topic of analyzing data that will be produced during software development was fascinating because I&rsquo;m a software developer.
And how cool is it to get new information and knowledge from data you have produced?!? So I continued to develop TYPO3-Analytics and started to do some little research about the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_Software_Repositories title="Mining Software Repositories at Wikipedia">Mining Software Repositories</a> field.</p><p>Due to this enthusiasm, I found my topic for my bachelor thesis: Software Repository Mining - Concept and Potentials.
In October / November 2013, I looked for a professor as an adviser, registered this topic at my university, started to research, and wrote this paper.
I continued to work at TYPO3-Analytics and CVSAnaly.
During this time, I found a lot of exciting papers about programming topics.
Here is a small list of this paper (if you want more, just ping me ;)):</p><ul><li><a href=https://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/dynjs/pldi275-richards.pdf title="Paper An Analysis of the Dynamic Behavior of JavaScript Programs">An Analysis of the Dynamic Behavior of JavaScript Programs</a></li><li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.76.3203&rep=rep1&type=pdf" title="Paper Analysis of Signature Change Patterns">Analysis of Signature Change Patterns</a></li><li><a href=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/729012 title="Paper Will My Patch Make It? And How Fast? Case Study on the Linux Kernel">Will My Patch Make It? And How Fast? Case Study on the Linux Kernel</a></li></ul><p>At <a href=https://fosdem.org/2014/ title="FOSDEM 2014">1st & 2nd February 2014 the FOSDEM event</a> retakes places in Brussels, Belgium.
Due to the communication at the <a href=https://lists.libresoft.es/listinfo/metrics-grimoire title="MetricsGrimoire mailinglist">MetricsGrimoire mailinglist</a> i knew that people from <a href=https://bitergia.com/ title=Bitergia>Bitergia</a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/jgbarah/ title="Jesus M Gonzalez-Barahona at twitter">@jgbarah</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/sanacl title="Luis Cañas-Díaz at twitter">@sanacl</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/dizquierdo title="Daniel Izquierdo at twitter">@dizquierdo</a>, etc.) were there as well.
I <a href=https://twitter.com/andygrunwald/status/428850540228132864 title="Contacting Bitergia via twitter">twittered that I want to meet them</a> and ~1 hour later we had a lovely chat in the cafeteria of the University of Brussels.
I showed and talked about the concepts of TYPO3-Analysis and got positive feedback.</p><p>~13 months later (since FOSDEM 2013), many things happen.
I learned about &mldr;</p><ul><li>new tools (CVSAnaly, Bicho, &mldr;)</li><li>a new programing language (Python)</li><li>a lot of programming experience</li><li>concepts with new tools (TYPO3-Analytics, <a href=https://www.rabbitmq.com/ title="Message queue system RabbitMQ">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href=https://supervisord.org/ title="Software supervisord">supervisord</a>, <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/ title="Software Vagrant">Vagrant</a>, <a href=https://www.getchef.com/chef/ title="Software Chef">Chef</a>&mldr;)</li><li>new friendly and interesting people (Jesus, Luis, Daniel, &mldr;)</li><li>a fresh business concept (Bitergia)</li><li>much new knowledge about an exciting research field I did not know before (Mining Software Repositories)</li></ul><p>And finally, I passed my Bachelor of Science degree today.</p><p>And the whole story might be another one if I had not to visit FOSDEM in February 2013.
A huge THANK YOU to all people who were part of this story (creator of tools, speaker, twitterer, IRC chat attendees, and other community members of the open-source world).
The whole time was a lot of fun.
Of course, there was stress, too.
But the fun was much more prominent.</p><p>And what is the conclusion of this story? I do not know.
Maybe visit conferences and be part of an amazing community? I do not know.
But I can recommend this way to try it out! If you need help to get into it, because you do not know how: Ping me :)
I will help you do get the right foot in!</p></section></article><div class="comments contribute-link"><h3>Bug? Typo? Contribute!</h3><p>Found a bug or a typo in this article?
