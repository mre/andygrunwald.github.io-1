, <a href=https://andygrunwald.com/tags/productivity/>Productivity</a></p></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Good book about moving towards your goals with (very) small steps.
Various insights into real-life stories, new perspectives, and practical tips on destroying bad or establishing new habits.
Recommended if you like <a href=https://jamesclear.com/articles title="Articles by James Clear">James articles</a> and his style.
The book is full of this: <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1847941834/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1847941834&linkId=655500f09dc93b189f346505fad8f425&tag=andygrunwal0a-21" rel=sponsored title="Atomic Habits by James Clear at Amazon">Go, buy, and read it</a>.</p><figure><img src=https://andygrunwald.com/img/posts/book-review-atomic-habits-james-clear/book-james-clear-atomic-habits-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones.jpg alt="Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones by James Clear"><figcaption><p>Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones by James Clear</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=why-did-i-read-this-book>Why did I read this book?</h2><p>I found James Clear via <a href=https://softwareleadweekly.com/issues/333 title="Issue #333 of the Software Lead Weekly">Issue #333 of the Software Lead Weekly</a> Newsletter with his article on <a href=https://jamesclear.com/3-stages-of-failure title="The 3 Stages of Failure in Life and Work (And How to Fix Them) by James Clear">The 3 Stages of Failure in Life and Work (And How to Fix Them)</a>.
His other <a href=https://jamesclear.com/articles title="Articles by James Clear">articles</a> also caught my interest.</p><p>I always had a high interest in productivity, time management, and getting better as yesterday.
I like to learn, to know the context and why we are doing it what we are doing.
Good habits can help you with all of this.
Maybe there are some new tricks in this book I never heard of?</p><h2 id=what-do-i-like-about-this-book>What do I like about this book?</h2><p><strong>Content</strong>: What James presents is enjoyable, actionable, and easy to follow.
He provides a simple and proven four-step framework on how to establish new habits.
Underlined with thousands of good examples from real life.
By doing this, he doesn&rsquo;t hide the complex reality and mentions areas like how hard it is to stick to your habits and how he overcomes this.
It will provide you new perspectives.</p><blockquote><p><em>Maybe if you <strong>really</strong> wanted it, you&rsquo;d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.</em></p><p>- <a href=https://twitter.com/JamesClear title="James Clear at twitter">James Clear</a> in <em>Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>James is not perfect</strong>: He has spent <em>some</em> time diving into the theory of habits, but he still keeps realistic.
James is mentioning that <em>it is inevitable that life will interrupt you [and your habits] at some point</em>.
It emphasizes the feeling that this is normal and human.
I like it.</p><p><strong>Reality</strong>: I especially like how James points out the hard truth of our lives: <em>Habits can get automatic and boring at some time</em>; <em>If you really want something, you do it. Otherwise, you don&rsquo;t want it enough</em>; <em>We still need to act on it</em>.
He doesn&rsquo;t try to hide it.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Your actions reveal how badly you want something</strong>. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don&rsquo;t really want it. It&rsquo;s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.</em></p><p>- <a href=https://twitter.com/JamesClear title="James Clear at twitter">James Clear</a> in <em>Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Side Stories</strong>: A lot of chapters start with small real-life Stories. Like how people have benefitted from little habits (how <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld title="Jerry Seinfeld at Wikipedia">Jerry Seinfeld</a> has trained writing jokes) or to underline a particular behavior (like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Asch title="Solomon Asch at Wikipedia">the influence of group pressure by Solomon Asch</a>).
It is fun to read them.
They don&rsquo;t come along like typical &ldquo;success stories&rdquo;, but more in a style that you can relate to.</p><p><strong>Awareness</strong>: James emphasizes the small things in your life and the world.
He highlights small steps.
He shifts your attention to &ldquo;<em>the obvious</em>, writes about this, and lets you think for a while.
It is about the small steps (1% better or <em>micro habits</em>) and the long run.
Not the big shot for the short term.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Academic&rdquo; notes</strong>: At the end of the book, there are 25 pages of references incl. Links, books, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier title="Digital Object Identifier at Wikipedia">doi&rsquo;s</a>.
These enable you to dive deeper into every area mentioned as in an academic report.</p><blockquote><p><em>[Establishing a habit] is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution.</em></p><p>- <a href=https://twitter.com/JamesClear title="James Clear at twitter">James Clear</a> in <em>Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Chapter Summaries</strong>: Every chapter ends with a few key sentences.
When you have finished this chapter, what should you keep in your mind?
I find those helpful and pleasant to look at later (e.g., in a reference style).</p><h2 id=what-can-make-this-book-better-in-the-next-edition>What can make this book better in the next edition?</h2><p><strong>Bonus chapters</strong>: There are bonus chapters mentioned about <a href=https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits/business title="How to apply the ideas from the book to business from James Clear">how to apply the ideas from the book to business</a> or <a href=https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits/parenting title="Tips on applying habits for parenting by James Clear">parenting</a>.
Sadly they are only available online.
Especially when you read this book at a location where you don&rsquo;t want the internet.
I would love to see those included in the book, even if this would raise the price.</p><h2 id=would-i-recommend-reading-this-book>Would I recommend reading this book?</h2><p><strong>Rather yes</strong>.</p><p>I enjoyed this book and had a good time reading it.
James is pointing out several new perspectives to look at things that <em>seem</em> to be simple, but in reality, they are not.
I am motivated to change my style while trying to establish new habits, stop bad ones, and apply a few presented techniques.</p><p>However, I think this book is not for everyone.
You need to be interested in the area of improving yourself; otherwise, you might not stick to complete this ~270 pages book.
