Yesterday, we had our May 2018 edition of the Web Engineering DUS Meetup with [five very different lightning talks](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/events/248019083/ "5 Talks: State of CSS, Learn to code, DevOps story, Side projects, WordPress at Web Engineering Düsseldorf").
Roundabout 75 people showed up.

[Dome](https://twitter.com/milchjieper "Dominik Siebel at twitter") and I run the [Web Engineering DUS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf "Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup") for quite some time, and we ask ourselves how we can improve the experience and the value of this event.
We try to play around with different formats of the evening, with a broad range of topics, various speakers, etc.
But this is often based on our ideas.
To get more insights, we asked the attendees for feedback yesterday.
Again. See the [satisfaction survey 2017]({{< ref "/post/webengdus-satisfaction-survey-2017.md" >}} "Web Engineering Düsseldorf Meetup: Satisfaction Survey 2017") for reference.
We did it the pragmatic way and used pen and paper to ask the attendees to write us feedback during the break.
A couple of people did, and here is the result:

> My 1st meetup. Impressive!

---

> Just thank you! <3 Keep it up!

---

> Great speakers, food and drinks

---

> Andy could allow more questions, but block/stop longer discussions. Great conference, would buy tickets again. Thanks!

---

> Very good variety in terms of topics, speakers, new concepts and beer

---

> Good topics, well prepared, directly applicable

---

> Great, thanks! Will definitely come to the future Meetups!

---

Thanks for all the feedback.
